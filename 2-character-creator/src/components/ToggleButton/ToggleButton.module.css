    HACK: If I was building this UI in real life, I would
    use Flexbox to lay out the group of buttons, using the
    “gap” property to add space between them, and
    controlling their alignment with “align-items”. Since
    we haven’t covered Flexbox in the course yet, I’m
    solving this using Flow layout, which requires a
    couple of additional properties
